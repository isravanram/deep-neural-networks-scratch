# üß† Neural Network from Scratch

This project demonstrates how to implement a **feedforward neural network** from scratch using only **NumPy**, without any high-level machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

---

## üîç Overview

The implementation includes:
- Forward propagation
- Activation functions: Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, Softmax
- Cost functions: Binary cross-entropy & categorical cross-entropy
- Backpropagation (gradient descent)
- Weight & bias initialization
- Prediction and evaluation functions
- Support for **binary** and **multi-class classification**
